# ðŸ›Œ Data Analysis of Human Health and Lifestyle â€“ Insights for a Healthier Life
## Project Overview:
- This project aims to analyze health and lifestyle data to uncover trends affecting sleep quality and overall well-being. By exploring correlations between occupation types, physical activity, and sleep disorders, the project offers data-driven insights and recommendations for healthier living. The analysis focuses on identifying risk factors and providing solutions to mitigate the prevalence of sleep disorders such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea.

## Objective:

- Perform comprehensive data analysis to understand the relationship between lifestyle factors (e.g., physical activity, stress, BMI) and health outcomes.
- Investigate how different occupations impact sleep quality and disorder prevalence.
- Develop recommendations based on empirical data to promote better health and quality of life.
  
## Dataset:

- Records: 374 entries
- Features: 13 attributes including age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, physical activity level, stress, BMI, blood pressure, heart rate, daily steps, and sleep disorder classification.
## Technologies & Tools:

- Python â€“ Core programming language for data analysis.
- Pandas â€“ Data preprocessing, handling missing values, and aggregation.
- Matplotlib â€“ Visualization of patterns and trends through bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
  
## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

- Handled missing data by filling null values with 'Normal' to ensure consistency.
- Renamed and reformatted columns for improved readability and analysis.
- Aggregated and grouped data by gender, occupation, and age to derive meaningful insights.
  
## Key Analyses Performed:

**Sleep Disorder Distribution:** Visualized with pie charts showing the proportion of individuals affected by Sleep Apnea, Insomnia, and those without disorders.
**Occupation Analysis:** Assessed the prevalence of sleep disorders across various occupations. Nurses and doctors exhibited higher instances of Sleep Apnea, while sales representatives were more prone to Insomnia.
**Gender-based Analysis:** Analyzed gender-specific trends in sleep disorder occurrences, highlighting that females showed higher rates of Sleep Apnea compared to males.
**Physical Activity Correlation:** Examined the relationship between physical activity levels and sleep quality, revealing that increased physical activity correlates with better sleep quality.
**Stress & Sleep Quality:** Explored the connection between stress levels and sleep duration, indicating that individuals with lower stress levels had higher sleep quality scores.

# Key Findings:

**Occupational Impact:** Health professionals (nurses and doctors) were more susceptible to sleep disorders, likely due to irregular working hours and high stress.
**Gender Disparities:** Females showed higher vulnerability to Sleep Apnea, while Insomnia was more common in males.
**Lifestyle Patterns:** Regular physical activity (â‰¥60 minutes/day) and sufficient sleep (7-9 hours/day) significantly reduced the likelihood of sleep disorders.
**High-risk Groups:** Individuals with high BMI and low daily step counts were more prone to experiencing sleep disturbances.

## Health Recommendations:

**Maintain Adequate Sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per day to improve mental and physical health.
**Regular Physical Activity:** Engage in at least 60 minutes of physical activity daily to boost cardiovascular health and reduce sleep disorder risks.
**Manage Stress:** Adopt stress management techniques to keep stress levels below 6 for improved sleep quality.
**Monitor BMI:** Maintain a normal BMI by following a balanced diet and regular exercise routine.
**Increase Daily Steps:** Walk a minimum of 6000 steps each day to enhance overall physical health and reduce sedentary behavior.

## Visual Insights:

- **Pie Chart:** Distribution of sleep disorders (Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, and Normal).
- **Bar Chart:** Sleep disorder occurrences across occupations.
- **Gender Analysis:** Comparison of sleep disorder prevalence between male and female participants.
- 
## Conclusion:
- This project underscores the critical link between lifestyle choices, occupational stress, and health outcomes. By adopting the suggested recommendations, individuals can improve their sleep quality and overall well-being.
